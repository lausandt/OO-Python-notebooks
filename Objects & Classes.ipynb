    "---\n",
    "When you start programming you get confronted with a lot of concepts that seem to have a meaning to most but you. However you do not need to worry about this lack of understanding for three very simple reasons.   \n",
    "\n",
    "1. You will learn the necessary concepts as you go along,\n",
    "2. quite a few of these concepts are badly understood by those that think they do (including me I suppose) \n",
    "3. a large body of these concepts are foremost of academic interest and are of little consequence in practical programming.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The first of the concepts is perhaps the programming paradigm. In science a paradigm is a set of assumptions, concepts, values, and practices that constitutes a way of viewing reality for the community that shares them, especially in an intellectual discipline. In computer science, which is very much an intellectual discipline, it is model with which we program. There are four main models/paradigms:   \n",
    "\n",
    "1. procedural\n",
    "2. object-oriented \n",
    "3. functional \n",
    "4. logical    \n",
    "\n",
    "Python allows you to programming procedural (scripting) and allows you to program with the object-oriented model, despite of what is sometimes said Python is not and will never be (dixit Guido van Rossum) be a functional programming language, nor wil it be logical programming language like Prolog.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook teaches you the basis of programming with the object oriented model."

    "#### **Why object-orientation?**\n",
    "Perhaps first we should answer the question why programming in the OO-model is so popular? If you DuckDuckGo for a reason why you should program in the OO-model there are many reasons that will be cited, reasons such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- code reusability\n",
    "- information hiding\n",
    "- limiting scope\n",
    "- etc etc    \n",
    "    \n",
    "However all of the aforementioned can easily be achieved in a functional language as Haskell too. So to me, this cannot be enough of a reason for the existence of the OO-model.    \n",
    "The success of the OO-model, I would suggest, is the ease with which we can model the real world in our programming. We look for traits that can represent a state and for functions that can change that state. The OO-model is as far as I am concerned not just a programming model it is also very much a design model. It would be wrong to separate these two sides of the OO-model, as we can see in the concepts of class and object."

    "#### **Class**   \n",
    "Scottish computer scientist David Watt defines a class to be a set of similar objects, these objects share components, e.g. variables and operations. However this (correct) definition might still be very opaque for the not computer scientist. So what is a class?  \n",
    "\n",
    "A class is model of something that exists in reality. It consists of certain traits (variables) that can hold the current state and certain operations on those traits (methods), that can change that state. A class is the design recipe for every object that belongs to it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Object**\n",
    "In the OO-model, objects are entities that combine state (the attributes/variables) behaviour (methods) and have an identity with which we can differentiate between objects.   \n",
    "\n",
    "A class is blue print for all objects of a certain type. An object is similar to a structure (hence C++/Go use structs), but an object has enhanced features (such as member access control). An object is a member of a class and needs to be instantiated to have a memory address so that the changes in state can be stored. An object only exists in runtime, a class exists as code (in a .py file in our case) outside runtime.    \n",

E.g., a car, it is made up of at least four other classes, the engine, the body, the interior, and the chassis, which themselves are made up of other classes. For instance, the engine knows pistons, a camshaft, an alternator, etc.\n",

    "#### **Composition** \n",

Take a bicycle as example, it is composed of several objects, for instance, a saddle, wheel, frame, you can't leave one of these off for without these there simply would not be a bicycle.    \n",

    "Before you play with class and try out the functionality of Car a few remarks:\n",

    "2. In Interior you find an interior class, could not resist the pun, we better call it an inner class, Dashboard. A dashboard is part the interior and does not make any sense outside the interior, yet it is a complicated thing with operations, there for it deserves its own class. These are the questions you should ask yourself if you write a complicated class, are there complicated objects in my class that have operations, if the answer is yes. Ask if it make sense that lives outside of your class, should it live on if your object is gone. If the answer is no, you should write an inner class, otherwise use object composition.\n",
    "3. Especially when using object composition, you might want to first initialize the outer object before initializing the inner objects, for instance because you need some attribute, like I need body_type, colour, and speed from the car object. @dataclass offers you __post_init__() which allows you to initialize some attributes (or a method if you want) directly after the object is created by the compiler, before control is handed back to you.    \n",
