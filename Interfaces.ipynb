    "## **Interfaces**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "The word interface has several meanings in programming. Often you hear people referring to an interface when they are actually talking about an Application Programming Interface, an API. This idea of an interface is the idea of a shared boundary between parts of a program, or even users and a program, for instance a GUI is also an interface, it is a Graphical User Interface. API and GUIs are not the type of interface we are discussing here.   \n",
    "\n",
    "In object-oriented design an interface has a different meaning. It is programming by contract (Betrand Meyer, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract), an interface is a collection of methods signatures e.g., `def signature(self, message: str)->str`, and sometimes attributes, that functions as a contract. It states that if you implement this interface then the class is of a certain type or subtype. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python knows three types of interfaces:   \n",
    " 1. Duck Typing\n",
    " 2. Abstract Base Classes \n",
    " 3. Static Protocols    \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook I will only discuss the first two. The latter needs to be used in conjunction with an external type checker like MyPy, and is not interesting for our discussion. The interfaces we do discuss are integral part of OO-programming/design and are must know for anyone who wishes to program in the object-oriented paradigm. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you were a bit confused with my somewhat opaque description of an interface, a simple example of Duck Typing will lift the veil.\n"

    "#### **DuckTyping** \n",
    "DuckTyping is the first kind of interface. it is the oldest interface in Python, and it is probably still most used. DuckTyping as an interface is a convention, it something programmers agree to. People who program in Python agree that DuckTyping is an interface, not that it actually is an interface, it is a class with unimplemented method (signatures), that sort of functions as an interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my opinion it is typical Python solution, flexible, easy to grasp. Unfortunately, impossible to enforce and prone to faults, but that is also Python. \n",

    "A simple DuckTyped bank account interface. As you can see all the methods have a signature, but no other body than pass. I need the ellipsis for not writing a true interface but one by convention, technically (as the keyword says) `BankAccount` is a class. Python has no separate concept of an interface. It knows an object (everything is an object) and everything has a type.\n",
    "\n",
    "The class functions here as an interface, subclass the interface and you have kind of a subtype. I will have to be incredibly careful with the wording here for Python lacks the ability distinct type and subtype, it can only make a distinction between base class and subclass. Which is why Pythonista's confuse the two often.\n",
    "\n",
    "The definitions of the two concepts are:\n",
    " * Type: A type is a set of values, equipped with one or more operations that can be applied uniformly to all these values\n",
    " * Class: A class is a set of similar objects. All objects of a class have similar components and are equipped with the same operations.\n",
    "    \n",
    "As you can see from these definitions, types and classes are nearly the same but there is a subtle difference. Type is related to and derived from set theory. We consider a set of values, for instance all integers $\\mathbb{Z}$ and the operations from $\\mathbb{Z} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}$ defined for it, such as $ +, -, \\times$. \n",
    "\n",
    "A class is obviously built upon this, but more limited in the sense that you would have to name the variables (I dare you to do this in $\\mathbb{Z}$) and freer, as you can pretty much define any method you want to on a class. Furthermore, you cannot recursively define classes, which you can do for types.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is complicated subject, I just touched on it, because, if nothing else, you should understand there is a difference between the two concepts. For more information on types see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system. \n"
