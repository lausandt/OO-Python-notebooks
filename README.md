# OO-programming-in-Python-notebooks

These notebooks contain information on object-oriented programming in Python. It is part of a series of notebooks on Python. Originally, these notebooks were written for my girlfriend, who retrained as a data engineer. 
I trained in Java as OO-language, I am not a Pythonista nor an expert in the language. So, I leaned on people who are experts in Python. Foremost Luciano Ramalho who wrote an excellent book called Fluent in Python.

Thanks to Lucianoâ€™s excellent work my own understanding of Python left the academical and moved to the practical. Where at my university circles Python is not highly regarded, I now do regard it highly, as flexible, fast to code, fast to a solution language.
My only disappointment with the language is that it never will be a functional language, but no matter in these notebooks we discuss object-oriented programming specific to Python. 

Finally, if you haphazardly stumble on the notebooks and you see mistakes, want to discuss points, please feel free to contact me on:
