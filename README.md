# OO-programming-in-Python-notebooks

These notebooks contain information on object-oriented programming in Python. It is part of a series of notebooks on Python. Originally, these notebooks were written for my girlfriend, who retrained as a data engineer. 
I trained in Java as OO-language, I am not a Pythonista nor an expert in the language. So, I leaned on people who are experts in Python. Foremost Luciano Ramalho who wrote an excellent book called Fluent in Python, but also Python doc and numerous PEPs which is great for understanding the reasoning behind the language. 

Thanks to Lucianoâ€™s (and others) 
excellent work my own understanding of Python left the academical and moved to the practical. Where at my university circles Python is not highly regarded, I now do regard it highly, as flexible, fast to code, fast to a solution language.
My only disappointment with the language is that it never will be a functional language, but no matter in these notebooks we discuss object-oriented programming specific to Python. 

The order in which these notebooks should be read is:
-	Objects & Classes
-	Inheritance
-	Interfaces
-	SOLID
-	Design patterns
-	Objects in Python
