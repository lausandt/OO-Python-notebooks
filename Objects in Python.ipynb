    "## **Objects in Python**\n",
    "This is the last notebook on object-oriented programming in Python. The subject of this notebook is the object, you might think this is a bit odd, after all objects have been the focus of all the notebooks. Though this is true our discussions on objects have been superficial, the object is the very core of Python as a programming language. Knowing how to manipulate objects in Python allows you to be a much more efficient and effective programmer.\n",
    "\n",
    "All object-oriented programming languages have objects, hence the name of course. An object is not much more than an allocated space in memory (on the heap), it has identification, a human readable name, it would be difficult to identify an object by its memory address. Finally, an object has the structure of a tagged tuple, a manner with which the object is constructed. The Python object is a mix of a C++ struct and a modula3 object. This mix delivers a flexible construct. A Python object is easy to use, easy to manipulate, but also quite difficult to protect from abuse. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python literally everything is an object, and everything is a subclass of object (If you don't know what a subclass is, this notebook is not for you, you should read the Inheritance notebook). Quite often you will see the base / sub class relation being made explicit by a line of code like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "`class ExampleOne(object):` \n",
    "\n",
    "The object is always the root of the directed acyclic graph (DAG) that is the Python object hierarchy. \n",
    "\n",
    "![afbeelding.png](attachment:c147500d-8486-4471-b714-210510cb8662.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "I have put the objects next to each other on purpose, for although Python has only one DAG you should consider object not to be the root, ExampleOne and ExampleTwo are not siblings. Instead you want to work with multiple object hierarchies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The meaning of `class ExampleOne(object):` is that this class ExampleOne has no other superclass than object itself. I think you should not make this relation explicit and use `class ExampleOne:`.  Object is not part of the class hierarchy you will create.\n",
    "\n",
    "I call the former explicit declaration, Google style, for I seem to recollect that at one time it stated in the Google Python style guide it was said to make this relationship explicit. I can't find it the current style guide so I might be wrong or they might have changed the style. However, using a style guide and a linter is a good idea, and why not use Google's style guide. See https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pylint is an example of a linter, pylint will give you advice on style and substance, make your code both less prone to bugs and much more readable for fellow programmers."

    "## **class objects & instance objects** \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two forms of object-oriented programming, there is the prototype programming, mostly known from JavaScript and other ECMA script dialects, and there is class based programming. Python is class based. As everything in Python is an object, Python objects come in two flavours:\n",
    "\n",
    " * class object\n",
    " * instance object\n",
    " \n",
    "The first to understand is the class object, the class object has two roles:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. to function as blueprint of all objects belonging to this class. \n",
    " 2. The second role is to create objects of this class. \n",
    " \n",
    "For the first role class defines & names attribute references, in doing so it creates the namespace of the object. A namespace is a set of signs (names) that are used to identify and refer to the attributes the object has. The use of the namespace is that it ensures names can reused over multiple objects, iff the object identifiers are unique. We can access the attributes by using the object identifier and the name. \n",
    "\n",
    "`ExampleOne.variable` & `ExampleTwo.variable`\n",
    "\n",
    "Python class objects have three types of attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Instance variables (confusingly so perhaps, these are mostly referred to as attributes in OO-speak)\n",
    " 2. Class variables\n",
    " 3. Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods we can further subdivide in:\n",
    " * regular methods\n",
    " * class methods\n",
    " * static methods\n",
    " \n",
    "Python also knows an abstract method but that belongs to the abc module not the class object itself.\n",

I will show you how to do that in a moment and will discuss data descriptors in depth later in this notebook.\n",

    "As you can see a Java class is very similar to a Python, loose from some syntax, the clear difference is in typing and in member access control.\n",

    "Java enforces typing (by the compiler), this is the reason why it is general faster, less prone to bugs, but also more difficult to learn and verbose. \n",
    "\n",
    "Java also enforces member access control, with the keywords private, protected, *no modifier*, and public. This in order of strictness. Java data attributes are usually private, meaning you cannot access them outside the class itself. Public is the same member access as Python has, pretty much unlimited access. \n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that Java knows member access control & static typing makes it easy to validate attributes both on type and value. There are compelling reasons why you want to control the validity of especially data attributes. Attributes determine the state of an object. What if we want to avoid undesireable states, states where attributes cannot have certain values, for these values will lead to unwanted behaviour or bugs. On a higher level, we want to avoid dependecies on implementations. A user of an API for instance, should not depend on the implementation of the methods presented in the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course Python has the \"private\" variable but those are not really private as you know. This lack of built-in member access makes it more difficult in Python to validate attributes. Therefore you will see quite often attributes \"validated\"with a error for type and an if/else for value. See the code below"
